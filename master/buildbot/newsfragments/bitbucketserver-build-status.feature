New reporter :py:class:`~buildbot.reporters.bitbucketserver.BitbucketServerCoreAPIStatusPush`.
Reporting build status has been integrated into `BitbucketServer Core REST API <https://docs.atlassian.com/bitbucket-server/rest/7.4.0/bitbucket-rest.html#idp219>`_ in `Bitbucket Server 7.4 <https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/bitbucket-server-7-4-release-notes-1013849643.html#BitbucketServer7.4releasenotes-cicdStreamlineyourworkflowwithIntegratedCI/CD>`_.
Old `BitbucketServer Build REST API <https://docs.atlassian.com/bitbucket-server/rest/7.4.0/bitbucket-build-rest.html#idp7>`_ is still working, but does not provide the new and improved functionality.
