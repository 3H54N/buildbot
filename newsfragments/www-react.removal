This release includes an experimental web UI written using React framework.
The existing web UI is written using AngularJS framework which is no longer maintained.
The new web UI can be tested by installing `buildbot-www-react` package and `'base_react': {}` key-value to www plugins.
Currently no web UI plugins are supported.
The existing web UI will be deprecated on subsequent Buildbot released and eventually replaced with the React-based web UI on Buildbot 4.0.
